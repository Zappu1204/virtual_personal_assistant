# Virtual Personal Assistant Multi-Agent System

A professional, multi-agent virtual personal assistant that integrates advanced AI, data processing, and external services to deliver a seamless and intelligent user experience. This system leverages a microservices architecture where each autonomous agent handles a specific domain—ranging from natural language processing and image/speech processing to scheduling and data management—while communicating and coordinating through a centralized orchestrator.

## Overview

This project is a multi-agent virtual personal assistant designed to offer users a rich set of functionalities including intelligent question answering, image and speech processing, personal data management, scheduling, and more. By adopting a multi-agent approach, the system ensures that each agent operates autonomously yet cohesively, allowing for scalability, enhanced fault tolerance, and dynamic load distribution. An API Gateway orchestrates the interactions among these agents and ensures secure, efficient routing of client requests.

## Features

- **Question Answering (QA) with RAG:**  
  Utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leveraging the OpenAI API to provide context-aware, accurate answers to user queries.

- **Image Answering & Processing:**  
  Process images using integrated OCR (e.g., Tesseract or Google Vision API) and provide image-based query responses.

- **Speech Processing:**  
  Enable text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) functionalities to facilitate natural, voice-driven interactions.

- **Personal Management:**  
  Manage academic information (e.g., GPA calculation, mark visualization), scheduling, and feedback mechanisms for personal data.

- **Data Crawling & Scheduling:**  
  Automate data collection using web crawling tools (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests) combined with cron job scheduling for periodic updates.

- **External Integrations:**  
  Incorporate external APIs such as image generators and talking-face services for enhanced interactive experiences.

- **Agent Autonomy & Coordination:**  
  Each agent is designed to operate autonomously, make independent decisions using AI and machine learning models, and communicate with other agents via a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) through a central orchestrator.

- **Robust Security & Scalability:**  
  Secure API access using token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2), ensure data protection, and scale individual agents based on load requirements.

- **Monitoring & CI/CD:**  
  Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to ensure high reliability and smooth deployments.

## Architecture

The system is built upon a **Microservices/Module-based Architecture** with a focus on multi-agent capabilities:

- **API Gateway:**  
  Serves as the single entry point for all client requests (web/mobile), handling routing, security, session management, and load balancing.

- **Core Agents (Microservices):**  
  Each agent is responsible for a specific functionality:
  - **LLM Agent:** Fine-tuned language models for natural language understanding and RAG.
  - **Academic Agent:** Manages academic data retrieval, GPA calculations, and performance analytics.
  - **Schedule Agent:** Integrates with calendar systems and handles notifications.
  - **Image Processing Agent:** Manages image OCR, processing, and image-based query responses.
  - **Speech Processing Agent:** Implements STT/TTS capabilities.
  - **News & Info Agent:** Retrieves and aggregates news, weather, and event information.
  - **School Information Agent:** Crawls and validates academic data from institutional sources.

- **Inter-Agent Communication:**  
  Agents interact asynchronously via a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and are coordinated by a central orchestrator that manages service discovery, load balancing, and dynamic routing.

- **Database Layer:**  
  - **SQL Databases** for structured data (user profiles, schedules, academic records).  
  - **NoSQL Databases** for unstructured data (logs, caching).

- **CI/CD & Monitoring:**  
  Automated pipelines for testing, building, and deployment are integrated along with comprehensive monitoring solutions.
