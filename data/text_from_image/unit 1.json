I'm ready for lunch.  : We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone  forgot to throw these empty paper bags away. There is litter everywhere!  : Why do people always leave litter around? It’s  not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people’s picnics.  : I think they are lazy. Or maybe they just don’t  care. Look, there are some empty cans and glass bottles under that tree, too.  : People should clean up before they leave, and  not leave litter lying around.  : That’s right. Well, after our picnic, let’s pick up  all the litter we can and take it out of here.  : OK! And next week, let’s come back with  friends and pick up some more.  : Good idea! "
